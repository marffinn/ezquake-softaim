# ezQuake Softaim ‚Äî A Gift to the Community

Dear QuakeWorld virtuosos,

It is with immense pleasure that I unveil the latest masterpiece: **ezQuake version 3.6.7**, now graced with softaim functionality so exquisitely crafted it could make a bot blush. Oh, and did I mention? It's **completely undetectable**‚Äîa true marvel of modern engineering, invisible to even the most eagle-eyed server admins among you. Better yet, it's so seamless that even the player using it will barely notice its subtle, game-changing touch. And stay tuned, because **undetectable timers are on the way**, ready to elevate your skills to even dizzier heights.

This gem exists because the powers-that-be refused to even consider my suggestions for truly securing the client‚Äîguess they thought their fortress was impregnable. So, I took matters into my own hands and crafted this little masterpiece. A special shoutout to **andeh**, **peppe**, **goniec**, **k4t**, and **goorol** for having such unwavering hope in me and for inspiring me to reach this glorious moment. Your support truly lit the fire under this project. Consider this my heartfelt gift to the community that so warmly embraced me before showing me the door with laughter ringing in my ears. May your frags be effortless, your matches suspiciously flawless, and your ban hammers forever swinging at shadows. Enjoy, champions.
